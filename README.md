I've recently made a career pivot into cybersecurity. With a strong background in business and a passion for creating solutions and safeguards, I'm excited to contribute my skills and experience to organizations and their users. I've undergone intensive training and mentorship from industry experts, gaining the technical expertise and confidence necessary for my next role. I obtained the CompTia Security+ Certification and completed the University of South Florida's Cyber Security Bootcamp, where I immersed myself in cybersecurity methodologies and technologies.  Now, I'm eager to leverage my diverse background and newfound cybersecurity expertise to contribute to an organization's security initiatives. I'm passionate about proactively identifying vulnerabilities, staying ahead of emerging threats, and implementing robust safeguards to protect systems and data. With my dedication, adaptability, and strong work ethic, I'm ready to make a meaningful impact in the field of cybersecurity.
